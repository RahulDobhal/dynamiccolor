# Dynamic Color Generator

A powerful color palette generator based on the Material Color Utilities and HCT color space. This tool allows you to:

1. **Convert Base Color to HCT**  
   - Take your hex/RGB input and convert to HCT (Hue, Chroma, Tone).  
   - HCT's "Tone" (0â€“100) matches perceived lightness.

2. **Generate Tonal Palette**  
   - Creates a full tonal palette with 15 tone steps: `[0, 4, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99, 100]`.  
   - Preserves the same hue and chroma values across all tones.  

3. **Position Input Color**  
   - Compares the input color's exact HCT tone to the fixed steps.  
   - Labels the closest tone to show where your starting color fits.

4. **Determine Text Color**  
   - Tests white (`#FFF`) and black (`#000`) for WCAG-compliant contrast on the primary color.  
   - Selects the best option based on contrast ratio.

5. **Generate Alpha Variants**  
   - Creates alpha variants (5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) for each tone.  
   - Useful for overlays, backgrounds, and hover states.
